		<h1 id="title_coffee">My Favourite SG Coffee Shops</h1>
		<p>
			Here are my favourtie cofee shops. This one is super close to my place and is recommended by my local friend who is addicted to coffee. He even
			has a coffee map to share with me. The shop is called Double Shot Coffee because they will also put two shot of espressor regardless of the item
			and the size you order. My favourtie is their flat white (usually I like hot flat white but considering the weather in Singapore, I always ordered
			iced flat white there).
    </p>
		<p>
			Interestingly, I find the owner of this coffee shop is also from Shanghai while
			I am Shanghainese too. So I visited even more afterwards. :)

		<p>
			There are also some unique local coffee places. If you are visiting Singapore, you have to stop at here for at least once because this is the 'national breakfast place'
			for Singaporeans that a kaya toast, boiled egg and coffee is a typical combo for breakfast. I personally found the kaya sauce really sweet but also unique enough so even
			everytime I feel a bit guilty for eating such sweet things, I still enjoy it a lot - probably because I have a sweet teeth by nature.
		</p>
		<p>
			By the way, the way to order local coffee is also very interesting, combining with some local dialects such as 'Kopi O' and 'Kopi C' - just try it yourself!
