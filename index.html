		<p>
			Hello there, thanks for dropping by! I am Freda - I enjoy food and taking photos of food using just my phone (yes just like
      everybody else!). I am currently studying in Ann Arbor, which is a nice town in Michigan at the States, but I spent my past 1.5 years working in Singapore. So I want to
      share some of my favourtie food places there since the memory is still somehow fresh, please bear with my poor photography skills and I am too lazy to photoshop them too because
			I don't trust my photoshop skills either, anyway, hope you will enjoy!
		</p>

    <h2 class="about_home">About this Website</h2>
    <p>
      Apart from this homepage, which contains a lot of meaingless and unimportant words from mine, since I am really talktive.
			This website mainly has three components for your interests - Introducing my favourtie restaurants and coffee shops
      in Singapore with some menu highlights and pictures, and a gallery of many random food pictures that I haven't had a chance
			to properly feature them all in the restaurant cofee shop pages. But I have included their address and shope name in the caption,
			therefore, if you find the picture appealing (I will be surprised and honoured if you feel so!), you can search them on Google too!
    </p>
