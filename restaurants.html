		<h2>Western Cuisine</h2>
		<p>
			Here are my recommendations for western cuisines. You can find different kinds of cuisines such as
			French, Italian, Spanish and many more! My Favourite is this Australian style fusion place - you can check out Tanjong Pagar area if you are interested in more of them.
			<br><br>
			Fun Fact: I went to this place with my ex and he happens to be Australian too. Interestingly, he told me this place was owned by
			his ex's friend so he went to there with his ex too. To be honest I didn't mind at all as long as the food is great (it is!).

    <h2>Eastern Cuisine</h2>
    <p>
      Here are my recommendations for eastern cuisines. You can find different kinds of cuisines such as
			Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Indonesian and many more food, especially those South East Asian flavours!
			One of my favourites is this Chinese porridge - you can also check out Chinatown and Geylang area for more options.
			<br><br>
			Note: The dish I had in the picture is frog leg porridge, which is really unique but I know some of my Western friends absolutely can't eat that, so you may consider
			other seafood porridge as substitution! Also, this place is cash-only so do please prepare some cash in advance.
